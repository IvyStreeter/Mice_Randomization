# Mice_Randomization
Mouse randomization is a tedious process. The number of groups and mice in your experiment increases the amount of time needed to organize a spreadsheet prior to drug treatment. This repo will focus on minimizing the mean and standard deviation between groups in the randomization process.

Version 1, listed as the ipynb file, takes a generalized approach to dividing groups into groups of similar mean and variance. This version is not recommended for use.

The final version, listed as the rmd file, uses anticlust to robustly approach this question and use with ease
